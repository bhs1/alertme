--------- Rewriting code with print statements -----------
Prefix: The following code extracts all available playing times from the given HTTP response content. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. Debug statements are added to help identify issues.
Debug Analysis: The first test case failed due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'text'. This indicates that the code attempted to access the 'text' attribute of a None object. The second test case failed because the output contained duplicate times for the 'Tennis' activity. This suggests that the code did not properly handle duplicate entries.
Test Case Analysis: For the first test case, the issue is likely due to the code not properly checking if the 'b' tag exists before attempting to access its 'text' attribute. For the second test case, the issue is likely due to the code not properly handling duplicate times for the same activity.
Improvement Plan: 1. Add checks to ensure that the 'b' tag exists before accessing its 'text' attribute. 2. Use a set to store times for each activity to avoid duplicates. 3. Add debug statements to print important variables and verify their values.

---GENERATING CODE SOLUTION---
--------- Rewriting code with print statements -----------
Prefix: The following code extracts all available playing times from the given HTTP response content. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. Debug statements are added to help identify issues.
Debug Analysis: The first test case failed due to a 'NoneType' object having no attribute 'text'. This indicates that the code attempted to access the 'text' attribute of a None object. The second test case failed because the output contained duplicate times for the 'Tennis' activity. This suggests that the code did not properly handle duplicate entries.
Test Case Analysis: For the first test case, the issue is likely due to the code not properly checking if the 'b' tag exists before attempting to access its 'text' attribute. For the second test case, the issue is likely due to the code not properly handling duplicate times for the same activity.
Improvement Plan: 1. Add checks to ensure that the 'b' tag exists before accessing its 'text' attribute. 2. Use a set to store times for each activity to avoid duplicates. 3. Add debug statements to print important variables and verify their values.
