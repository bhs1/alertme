    Explain for each failing test case how does the actual output differ from the expected output and why do you think that is? If useful, consider the Debug Output when reasoning about your response.
    
    Note: To save resource, try to avoid printing entire HTTP requests or json, instead only print parts that may be useful for debugging     you may wish to summarize the structure in plain text the parts that you choose leave out.
     
    (2) Construct an improvement plan to fix the test failures. When formulating this plan, observe the previous solutions
    shown above and try not to repeat fixes that we already know do not lead to a fix.
        
    (3) Sketch out the specific pseudocode of the fixes you plan to implement. Feel free to include actual code snipits. 

 and as a result of the above prompt you gave this relfection summary:

 ### Analysis of Test Failures

#### Test Case 0:
- **Actual Output**: Exception `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'text'`
- **Expected Output**: `{'Pickleball / Mini Tennis': ['9:30pm'], 'Tennis': ['9:30pm']}`
- **Reason**: The error indicates that the code is trying to access the `text` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This likely means that the `find` method did not find the expected element, and thus returned `None`.

#### Test Case 1:
- **Actual Output**: `{'Pickleball / Mini Tennis': ['9:00pm', '9:30pm'], 'Tennis': ['8:00pm', '8:30pm', '9:00pm', '9:30pm', '9:00pm', '9:30pm']}`
- **Expected Output**: `{'Pickleball / Mini Tennis': ['9:00pm', '9:30pm'], 'Tennis': ['8:00pm', '8:30pm', '9:00pm', '9:30pm']}`
- **Reason**: The actual output contains duplicate times for the 'Tennis' activity. This suggests that the code is not correctly handling or filtering out duplicate entries.

### Improvement Plan

1. **Handle `NoneType` Errors**:
   - Ensure that the `find` method calls are checked for `None` before attempting to access their attributes.
   - Add error handling to skip or log entries that do not match the expected structure.

2. **Remove Duplicates**:
   - Use a set to store times temporarily to automatically handle duplicates, then convert it back to a list.

### Pseudocode and Code Snippets

#### Step 1: Handle `NoneType` Errors

- **Pseudocode**:
  1. Loop through each cell in `time_cells`.
  2. Check if the `find` method returns `None` before accessing the `text` attribute.
  3. If `None`, skip the current iteration.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  for cell in time_cells:
      activity_tag = cell.find('b')
      if activity_tag is None:
          continue  # Skip this cell if no activity tag is found
      activity = activity_tag.text.strip().replace(' -', '')
      times = [a.text.strip() for a in cell.find_all('a')]
      
      if activity in times_dict:
          times_dict[activity].extend(times)
      else:
          times_dict[activity] = times
  ```

#### Step 2: Remove Duplicates

- **Pseudocode**:
  1. Use a set to store times for each activity.
  2. Convert the set back to a list before storing it in the dictionary.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  for cell in time_cells:
      activity_tag = cell.find('b')
      if activity_tag is None:
          continue  # Skip this cell if no activity tag is found
      activity = activity_tag.text.strip().replace(' -', '')
      times = [a.text.strip() for a in cell.find_all('a')]
      
      if activity in times_dict:
          times_dict[activity].update(times)  # Use set to avoid duplicates
      else:
          times_dict[activity] = set(times)
  
  # Convert sets back to lists
  for activity in times_dict:
      times_dict[activity] = list(times_dict[activity])
  ```

### Final Implementation

```python
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def extract_playing_times(html_content):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    times_dict = {}
    
    # Find all table cells that contain the times
    time_cells = soup.select('#times-to-reserve td')
    
    for cell in time_cells:
        activity_tag = cell.find('b')
        if activity_tag is None:
            continue  # Skip this cell if no activity tag is found
        activity = activity_tag.text.strip().replace(' -', '')
        times = [a.text.strip() for a in cell.find_all('a')]
        
        if activity in times_dict:
            times_dict[activity].update(times)  # Use set to avoid duplicates
        else:
            times_dict[activity] = set(times)
    
    # Convert sets back to lists
    for activity in times_dict:
        times_dict[activity] = list(times_dict[activity])
    
    return times_dict

# Function to get input from global_input
def get_input():
    global global_input
    return global_input

# Function to set output to global_output
def set_output(output):
    global global_output
    global_output = output

# Main function to execute the logic
def main():
    html_content = get_input()
    playing_times = extract_playing_times(html_content)
    set_output(str(playing_times))

# Execute main function
main()
```

This implementation should handle the `NoneType` errors and remove duplicate times, addressing the issues observed in the test cases.

Main directive: Rewrite the code to fix the test cases. Be sure to follow the plan in the reflection summary.
        
IMPORTANT: Also, print out intermediate variable names for debugging purposes. Instead of print() append to global variable debug_output. At first debug_output can be simple, but as you fail a test more times, you should add more and more details and variables to debug_output until we find the issue. Remember to define "global debug_output" at the top of any scope that updates debug_output.
